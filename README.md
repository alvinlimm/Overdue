# Power BI Dashboard: Overdue Purchase Order & Supplier Delay Analysis

This project showcases a Power BI dashboard that analyzes **purchase order delivery performance** using a simulated procurement dataset. The goal is to provide actionable insights into **supplier reliability**, **delivery punctuality**, and **average delays**.

> Built using beginner-level Power BI features â€” perfect for demonstrating domain knowledge with analytics storytelling.

---

## Project Objectives
- Identify which suppliers frequently deliver late
- Track the **number of overdue POs** and **average delay days**
- Visualize delivery trends over time
- Support procurement and supply chain teams with data-driven decisions

## Tools & Skills Applied
| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **Power BI** | Data modeling, DAX (basic measures), visual design |
| **DAX** | Created `Delay (Days)`, `Overdue Flag`, and trend analysis |
| **Excel/CSV** | Simulated procurement data preprocessing |
| **Data Storytelling** | KPI cards, bar/line/pie charts for executive-level insight |
